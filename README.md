Steam Discovery Queue Completer
===

Steam's seasonal sales often include a reward for "exploring" 3 [discovery
queues][0], but these are tedious tasks to complete; this script automates the
process. After you start a queue the script will click through the recommended
games, handle the age check and age gate pages (by setting your birthday to 1
January 1990), and will even start another queue afterwards provided you haven't
earned all of the cards you can for the day.

## Installation
**\* Note that this currently only works for Chrome.**
1. Install [Tampermonkey][1]
2. Install [the script][2]
